<h3>The Month of the Phillips Norelco OneBlade</h3>

<p>On the first day of the Year of the Phillips Norelco OneBlade the retail pharmacy assistant sat alone in the kitchen of a friend whilst the rest of the house slept, and opened a digital copy of <em>Infinite Jest.</em> The previous year, an evening ago—in yet another psychosomatic fit of bulimia likely induced by emotional- and financial-anxiety, then further lubricated by a healthy amount of alcohol—he had expunged his gut out onto the pizza he had ordered and so the following morning felt all too keenly empathetic towards Hal Incandenza as he too found himself in that analytically paralytic “infirmar[y] for for public distress” of a restroom. As he approached the first chapters conclusion the house began to awaken and he was joined by a close friend who curiously interrogated him on his first impressions of the novel. To this he offered a lie by omission referring to it merely as verbose since discussing the sharp impact of the prose thus far would let on perhaps too much for his exhausted capacity for emotional vulnerability at the time. He drove home and when there stowed himself away to complete the novel’s first 100 pages in a day.</p>

<p>He’s hooked, though at this point not by the novel’s characters and content but by Wallace’s kaleidoscopic structure which reads like the slowly unravelling layers of a mystery box as they fold in on one another; the solution of each element influencing others and slowly outlining the vast shape of the whole.<sup><a id="ffn1" href="#fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> The retail pharmacy assistant attends his work the next day and finds himself overwhelmed by the sheer comprehensiveness with which this 10% sliver of a book had already encompassed the people, procedures, and products which fill the store’s world. He smiles as he sees the all too familiar substance abusers enter, smirks as the pharmacists attend to patients with that “vaguely fake frown of puzzled concentration” and sniggers as he fills a shelf of Depend Adult Undergarments.</p>

<ol id="footnotes">
	<li id="fn1">Notably, the most superficial and well-known of David Foster Wallace’s characteristics—namely, his extensive use of endnotes—is the least of interest to the reader. The notes are at best portions that should be included in the body text and at worst superfluous errata mostly included to stoke the ego of either the author or reader. <a href="#ffn1">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></li>
